**Image Generator: Synthesize & generate images**

## 💡 Inspiration

The influencer marketing industry is worth $21 billion, but it's broken. Brands struggle with:

- **High Costs**: Top influencers charge $100K+ per post
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: Coordinating shoots is a nightmare
- **Limited Control**: Can't guarantee content quality or brand alignment
- **Authenticity Issues**: Fake followers and engagement manipulation

We imagined: _What if you could create the perfect influencer for your brand?_

Someone who:

- Never asks for money upfront
- Is always available for "shoots"
- Perfectly embodies your brand values
- Generates unlimited content variations
- Never has scheduling conflicts or ego issues

That's how **Clonefluencer** was born—democratizing influencer marketing through AI.
